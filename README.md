# ToeflExam

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Lighthouse performance audit

Start the Angular development server in one terminal:

```bash
npx ng serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4200
```

Then run the automated audit in another terminal:

```bash
npm run lighthouse
```

The audit checks performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Reports are written to `reports/`. The command exits with code `1` when a configured threshold is not met.

Optional environment variables include `LIGHTHOUSE_URLS`, `LH_RUNS`, and the `LH_MIN_*` threshold variables.

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
